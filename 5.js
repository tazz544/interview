console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3);



























// An educated answer to this question would simply be: “You can’t be sure. it might print out 0.3 and true, or it might not. Numbers
// in JavaScript are all treated with floating point precision, and as such, may not always yield the expected results.”
